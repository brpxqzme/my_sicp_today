The second chapter, “Building Abstractions with Data”, starts with pairs associating data with other data, procedures representing data without regard to its internal structure, and procedures representing data.

# 2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction

Exercise 2.1 follows section 2.1.1 (Example: Arithmetic Operations for Rational Numbers), in which a pair is used to represent a rational number and sign-corrects if necessary—but no other checking yet!

Exercises 2.2–2.3 follow section 2.1.2 (Abstraction Barriers), in which simple constructors and selectors abstract data away from implementation.

Exercises 2.4–2.6 follow section 2.1.3 (What Is Meant by Data?) and feature procedures that behave like data (pairs and Church numerals).

Exercises 2.7–2.16 are an integrated part of section 2.1.4 (Extended Exercise: Interval Arithmetic). Aside from the main topic concerning engineering within tolerances, there is a taste of acceptable ideas not matching expectations and onerous burdens being added by “experts”.

# 2.2 Hierarchical Data and the Closure Property

Exercises 2.17–2.20 are a part of section 2.2.1 (Representing Sequences), subsection “List operations”. It takes what we ought to already know about procedures and integrates the list data types into this thinking (car, cdr, cons primitives). Exercises 2.21–2.23 follow subsection “Mapping over lists” and cover usage of map, cons used certain ways not giving expected results to people not used to it yet, and the for-each procedure.

Exercises 2.24–2.29 are part of section 2.2.2 (Hierarchical Structures), and
feature lists within lists, which are interpretable as trees. Exercises 2.30–2.32 follow subsection “Mapping over trees”, of which 2.30–2.31 are about that, and 2.32 (set of all subsets) is less that and more expanding a list of lists using map.
