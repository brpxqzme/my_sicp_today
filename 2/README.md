The second chapter, “Building Abstractions with Data”, starts with pairs associating data with other data, procedures representing data without regard to its internal structure, and procedures representing data.

# 2.1 Introduction to Data Abstraction

Exercise 2.1 follows section 2.1.1 (Example: Arithmetic Operations for Rational Numbers), in which a pair is used to represent a rational number and sign-corrects if necessary—but no other checking yet!

Exercises 2.2–2.3 follow section 2.1.2 (Abstraction Barriers), in which simple constructors and selectors abstract data away from implementation.

Exercises 2.4–2.6 follow section 2.1.3 (What Is Meant by Data?) and feature procedures that behave like data (pairs and Church numerals).

Exercises 2.7–2.16 are an integrated part of section 2.1.4 (Extended Exercise: Interval Arithmetic). Aside from the main topic concerning engineering within tolerances, there is a taste of acceptable ideas not matching expectations and onerous burdens being added by “experts”.
