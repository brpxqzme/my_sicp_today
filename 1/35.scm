;; Exercise 1.35: Proof of phi as fixed point, computation thereof and thereby

;; phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2
;; it is a fixed point if f(phi) = phi
;; (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = 1 + 1/((1 + sqrt(5))/2) ; substitute phi into both sides
;; (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = 1 + 2/(1 + sqrt(5))     ; resolve RHS double inversion
;; 1 + sqrt(5) = 2 + 4/(1 + sqrt(5))         ; cancel out 2 (*)
;; 1 + 2sqrt(5) + 5 = 2(1 + sqrt(5)) + 4     ; cancel out pesky denominator
;; 6 + 2sqrt(5) = 2 + 2sqrt(5) +  4          ; distribute 2 on RHS
;; 6 + 2sqrt(5) = 6 + 2sqrt(5)               ; resolve additions

;; therefore, phi is a fixed point of x â†¦ 1 + 1/x
